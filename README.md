## Week 1

### Review social network documentation and refine/amend the social network/app Project Definition and Requirements. 
My current social network includes a messaging area (simular to discord) for development groups, the ability to ask for help on different programming languages, and the ability to upload games for feedback.
This is too complicated to make, so I will attempt to amend this project into something more simpler.
My new idea still involves the topic of programming, but instead will focus on the ability to ask for help on different programming languages, instead of any of the additonal requirements.

### Requirements definitions should include Functional (what the app will do) and Non-functional (what the app will look like and how it will perform). 
My functional requirement will include:
-The ability to sign/log into your account
-The ability to go to different subpages focused on a specific programming language.
-The ability to message and ask for help on programming
My non-functional requirements will include:
-Clear labels on subpages
-Good positioning for text
-Good asthetics
-Minimal loading time

### Please consider the scope of the project and what is able to be offered within the  timeframe - Mr Clark will talk you through this aspect of the project.
This may be too complicated (especially the messaging), but I will attempt to make this work. If I don't have enough time, then I'll change the requirements to focus on pre-built tutorials rather than messaging.
